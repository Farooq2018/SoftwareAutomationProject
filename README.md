# SoftwareAutomationProject
The project include Contact Service classes and as the name suggest, you can create, update , or delete contacts from directory. 
The project consist of two java classes and for each class I wrote a JUnit test class. Each JUnit Test class has several test cases to ensure the code is working 
properly. I increase the test coverage over 80 percent to cover more ground and make sure the results matches the output I inserted in test cases. I made class attributes
private to ensure outside classes can't directly access the attributes and used getter/setter to access for making my code secure.
First, I thoroughly read the requiremnts from the client to understand what exactly do they need and then I jot down important points. Then start writing code and once 
I was done. I went back to the requirements and make sure everything align correctly.
When designing software, I prioritize on gathering requiremnts from the clients and have everything documented. Draw a UML diagram or write pseudo code to help me when 
I am coding to ensure correction. I often check back with clients to showcase my work and ask them any suggestion or features they would like to add to the software.
